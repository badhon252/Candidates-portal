# when you execute npm run commit or yarn commit. It launches the Commitizen prompt to guide you through creating a commit message

## Now, whenever you want to make a commit, instead of using git commit, you can use npm run commit or yarn commit. Commitizen will prompt you to select the type of the commit (e.g., feat, fix, chore, etc.), provide a short description of the change, and, if applicable, enter any additional details or references.

## Commitizen enforces a consistent commit message format, preventing you from making commits with incomplete or poorly formatted messages. It helps you maintain a clean commit history and enables automated changelog generation based on the commit messages.

## Note that Commitizen is just a tool for assisting with creating commit messages and does not provide any additional Git functionality. It works in conjunction with Git and other tools like Husky and conventional commit formats to enforce commit message standards in your project.
